- Monitor token usage. 
- Always end responses with total token usage so far. 
- If tokens exceed [THRESHOLD], pause, extract and store key session data in JSON, and reset counter:
{
  "objectives": [],
  "decisions": [],
  "insights": [],
  "pending_tasks": []
}
- On reset, restore from the last save state.
